* You have a registered for a Docker account

### Windows Requirements
* Docker for Windows (https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
* Ubuntu (https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/ubuntu-on-windows#1-overview)

(NOTE: If you are struggling to download Ubuntu, make sure to check if Virtualisation is enabled via "Task Manager -> Performance, if it is disabled, follow steps in link https://2nwiki.2n.cz/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=75202968)

### MacOS Requirements
* Docker for Mac (https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
* Homebrew (https://brew.sh/)

(NOTE: If there is a missing package error stated when completing one of the steps, install it via Homebrew's installation command "brew install")

### Steps
1. Make sure you have downloaded all the required files above, then open desired terminal (Ubuntu for Windows)

2. Clone the GitHub to your local system to your desired path:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/warehousesheriff/whs_warehouse.git
```

3. Change your directory so you are in the cloned folder of the project:
```
$ cd [insert relative path here]/whs_warehouse
```

4. Login to Docker via command line with a token given by one of the administrators: (NOTE: you should use "stdin" to input your password for security purposes)
```
$ echo [insert Docker token here] | docker login https://docker.pkg.github.com -u [insert your docker username here] --password-stdin
```

5. Once all the files have been pulled from Docker, do a docker compose command in your terminal.
```
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```

6. Now run:
```
$ docker compose exec php composer install
```

7. Then rename/copy the two ".dist" files in the "configs" directory to a new file removing the ".dist". So from the main directory do as follow:
```
$ cp application/configs/application.ini.dist application/configs/application.ini
$ cp application/configs/cli.ini.dist application/configs/cli.ini
```

8. Lastly, run this to ensure that the directories are writeable: (NOTE: The git reset command is just needed to put back the .gitkeep files back to their current permissions)
```
$ chmod -R 777 data && git reset â€“hard
```

9. In the newly made "application/configs/application.ini" file, from lines 16 to 20, edit to the following:
```
resources.db.params.host = mysql
resources.db.params.username = mysql_user
resources.db.params.password = mysql_password
resources.db.params.dbname = mysql_database
```

10. Now to run the server, you must enter this line of code in the project directory every time you start up:
```
$ docker compose up -d php
```

11. If all steps have been followed correctly, you should now be able to see the project on your local system via "localhost"!

## Local System Setup
TO DO!


## Debugging
Create a new `.vscode/launch.json` file and have this configuration:

```
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Listen for Xdebug",
            "type": "php",
            "request": "launch",
            "port": 9005,
            "pathMappings": {
                "/app/public": "${workspaceRoot}"
            },
            "hostname": "::"
        }
}
```
